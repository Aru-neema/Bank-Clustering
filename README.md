# Bank-Clustering
## Objective Statement:

This is a case study about develop a customer segmentation from a given bank dataset and analyse it to develope credit card promotional offers to its customers.

## Case Steps
Following steps are taken to solve this case

1.1 Read the data, to do the necessary initial steps, and exploratory data analysis (Univariate, Bi-variate, and multivariate analysis).

1.2 Do the scaling of variables

1.3 Apply hierarchical clustering to scaled data and then identify the number of optimum clusters using Dendrogram 

1.4 Apply K-Means clustering on scaled data and determine optimum clusters. Apply elbow curve and silhouette score to find the optimum cluster number

1.5 Describe cluster profiles for the clusters defined. Recommend different promotional strategies for different clusters.


## Descriptive analysis
Univariate Analysis
Bivariate Analysis
Graph analysis

## Cluster ANalysis method:
Agglomerative clustering
K Means CLustering

## Expected Outcome:
To come up with a promotional strategy based on customer profile after clustering

## Data Understanding
The dataset has 7 columns and 210 rows.

## Data Dictionary:
•	Amount spent by the customer per month (in 1000s)

•	advance_payments: Amount paid by the customer in advance by cash (in 100s)

•	probability_of_full_payment: Probability of payment done in full by the customer to the bank

•	current_balance: Balance amount left in the account to make purchases (in 1000s)

•	credit_limit: Limit of the amount in credit card (10000s)

•	min_payment_amt : minimum paid by the customer while making payments for purchases made monthly (in 100s)

•	max_spent_in_single_shopping: Maximum amount spent in one purchase (in 1000s)
